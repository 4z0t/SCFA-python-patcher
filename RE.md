We are looking for experienced reverse engineers to improve SCFA's engine and expand it's functions.
Right now we are having goal to improve and expose some of the UI's functionality to have more control over it in Lua.
Specifically user's input and what user can see in UI.

There are 2 main fields where we need help:

* Reverse engineering: revesing
  * structures and classes of engine and their names
  * functions' logic and their names
* Engine recreation: with given decompiled parts of engine
  * recreate functions in C/C++
  * recreate structures and classes in C/C++
  * recreate generic structures and algorithms in C/C++

Tooling:

* C/C++
* GCC inline x86 asm
* IDA + x64dbg
* a bit of Lua + its API

Dedicated repositories:

* [C++ patcher](https://github.com/FAForever/FA_Patcher)
* [Python patcher](https://github.com/4z0t/SCFA-python-patcher)
* [Game's executable patches](https://github.com/FAForever/FA-Binary-Patches)
